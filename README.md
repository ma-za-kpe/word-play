# word-play

- Create a form where users may enter a sentence.
- Turn that sentence into an array using the split method.
- Then, loop through this array to build a new array out of every word in the sentence that is 3 or more characters in length.
- Finally, reverse the order of the new array, join it back together into a string, and display it to the user.
